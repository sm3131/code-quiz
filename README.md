# Code Quiz

# Description

The Code Quiz Challenge is a program powered by Javascript that allows users to take an interactive quiz about Javascript concepts. This quiz was created to allow people to compete against themselves or others to try and achieve the highest score. This program has a user friendly interface, with explicit instructions to guide the user through the program. The code quiz is a timed assessment, with multiple choice questions, and it collects user information to store their scores.

# Functionality

The code quiz is set-up as follows:
- Upon opening the quiz the user will find the intro screen with detailed instruction about how to navigate through the entire quiz.
- When the user presses the 'start quiz' button the timer will start and the first question will be presented to the user.
- Every question is multiple choice, so once the user clicks on an answer, they will be provided with feedback to inform them if they answered the question correct or incorrect.
- The user is then immediately presented with the next question.
- If a user answers a question correctly they will earn one point, if they answer incorrectly 5 seconds will be removed from their time.
- The code quiz will end when either the timer runs out or the user answers every question.
- When the quiz ends a screen will appear with an input field for the user to enter their initials in order to store their score.
- After submitting their initials, another screen will appear showing the person's initials with the highest score up to date.
- The user can then choose to either play again or clear all high scores recorded.

# Credit

This project was created from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. All of the code was written by myself, Sammi Moore. I used resources such as [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) in order to find documentation and tips for various coding syntax and functionality. Jason Moore also contributed his time and knowledge to help with the planning and debugging aspects of this project.
